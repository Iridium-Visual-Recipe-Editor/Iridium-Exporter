# Iridium

## This Mod - The Exporter

This mod acts as a data collector for the upcoming program Iridium. It will collect item data and item images from in your game to use with Iridium.

### How to Use

Use the command `/iridium exporter` and one of its three parameters:

*   `all`: Runs all data collection methods.
*   `itemdata`: Only generates the itemdata.txt file.
*   `itemimages`: Only generates the item images.

All data generated will be put inside the Minecraft directory under the folder "exporteddata".

### Credits
I'd like to thank the mods [IconExporter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/iconexporter) and [TellMe](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tellme) for taking a fair amount of inspiration from their code.
